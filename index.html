<h1> Correlation vs Causation</h1>
<p>
1. Correlation is used to show the relationship between two variables, but it must be linear. Non linear functions cannot have correlation because it is a curve. </p>
<p> 
2. Causation is based off of looking at the explanatory variables as the causes for change on the response variables. Correlation does not imply causation but can be used as clues if solid enough. The only way to determine causation is to run randomized controlled experiments that can rule out extraneous factors.

3. The plot that examines ENEM scores uses different colors to depict the difference between public schools and private schools with the x axis showing the ENEM scores and the y axis showing the percentage of participation rate. The heat map was launched the day after Osama Bin Laden was killed, and in this plot, you answer a question with multiple responses and each answer represents a dot. The areas on the graph with the most color is the most answered questions. Scatter plot matrices are tailored to explore multi-variable data and they can provide a rich, big picture view of the relationship between multiple variables.
